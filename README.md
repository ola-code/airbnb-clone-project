Airbnb Clone ‚Äì Backend Overview

üöÄ Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone is a full-stack project that replicates the core functionalities of Airbnb, focusing on building a robust backend to manage user interactions, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. This backend is designed for scalability, performance, and ease of integration with frontend clients.

üèÜ Project Goals
User Management: Secure registration, login, and profile updates.

Property Management: Create, update, and manage property listings.

Booking System: Enable users to book properties and manage reservations.

Payment Processing: Integrate a secure transaction system for bookings.

Review System: Allow users to post and manage property reviews.

Data Optimization: Improve performance with caching and efficient database indexing.

‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack
Backend Framework: Django, Django REST Framework (DRF)

Database: PostgreSQL

Query Language: GraphQL (for flexible and efficient queries)

Asynchronous Tasks: Celery with Redis as a message broker

Caching: Redis

Containerization: Docker

CI/CD: GitHub Actions and automated pipelines

üìö Learning Objectives
This project helps developers:

Master collaborative workflows using GitHub

Deepen backend development skills using Django and SQL

Implement secure, production-ready REST and GraphQL APIs

Design and optimize relational databases

Build and deploy using Docker and CI/CD pipelines

Understand real-world team roles and software engineering best practices

‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack
This project leverages a modern and scalable technology stack to support core Airbnb-like functionalities including listings, bookings, payments, and reviews.

Technology	Purpose
Django	A high-level Python web framework used for building robust backend systems and RESTful APIs.
Django REST Framework (DRF)	An extension of Django for creating and managing RESTful API endpoints with ease.
PostgreSQL	A powerful open-source relational database used to store structured data such as users, properties, bookings, and payments.
GraphQL	A flexible query language that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving API performance and usability.
Celery	An asynchronous task queue used for background job processing, such as sending notifications or handling delayed tasks like payment processing.
Redis	An in-memory data store used for caching and as a message broker for Celery to improve performance and speed up task processing.
Docker	A containerization tool used to create consistent development, testing, and deployment environments across machines.
GitHub Actions (CI/CD)	Automates testing, building, and deploying code through Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines.

üóÉÔ∏è Database Design
This project uses a relational database (PostgreSQL) to model real-world entities and their interactions. Below are the primary entities, their key fields, and relationships.

üìå Key Entities & Fields
1. Users
Represents guests and hosts using the platform.

Key Fields:

id: Primary identifier

name: Full name of the user

email: Unique email address (used for authentication)

is_host: Boolean flag to distinguish between guests and hosts

date_joined: Timestamp of account creation

2. Properties
Represents property listings created by hosts.

Key Fields:

id: Primary identifier

title: Name or title of the listing

description: Details about the property

location: Address or general location

price_per_night: Cost to book the property per night

host_id: Foreign key referencing the Users table

3. Bookings
Tracks reservations made by users on properties.

Key Fields:

id: Primary identifier

user_id: Foreign key to Users (the guest making the booking)

property_id: Foreign key to Properties (the booked property)

check_in: Date of check-in

check_out: Date of check-out

status: Booking status (e.g., confirmed, cancelled)

4. Reviews
Allows users to review properties they‚Äôve stayed in.

Key Fields:

id: Primary identifier

user_id: Foreign key to Users (the reviewer)

property_id: Foreign key to Properties (the reviewed property)

rating: Numeric score (e.g., 1‚Äì5)

comment: Text feedback from the user

5. Payments
Handles transactions for bookings.

Key Fields:

id: Primary identifier

booking_id: Foreign key to Bookings

amount: Total payment amount

payment_date: Date of transaction

payment_status: Status of the payment (e.g., successful, failed)

üîó Entity Relationships
A User can have multiple Properties (if they are a host).

A Property can have many Bookings, but each Booking belongs to one Property.

A Booking is made by one User and for one Property.

A Review is posted by a User for a Property and is typically linked to a past Booking.

A Payment is associated with a single Booking.
