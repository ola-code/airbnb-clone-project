üóÉÔ∏è Database Design
This project uses a relational database (PostgreSQL) to model real-world entities and their interactions. Below are the primary entities, their key fields, and relationships.

üìå Key Entities & Fields
1. Users
Represents guests and hosts using the platform.

Key Fields:

id: Primary identifier

name: Full name of the user

email: Unique email address (used for authentication)

is_host: Boolean flag to distinguish between guests and hosts

date_joined: Timestamp of account creation

2. Properties
Represents property listings created by hosts.

Key Fields:

id: Primary identifier

title: Name or title of the listing

description: Details about the property

location: Address or general location

price_per_night: Cost to book the property per night

host_id: Foreign key referencing the Users table

3. Bookings
Tracks reservations made by users on properties.

Key Fields:

id: Primary identifier

user_id: Foreign key to Users (the guest making the booking)

property_id: Foreign key to Properties (the booked property)

check_in: Date of check-in

check_out: Date of check-out

status: Booking status (e.g., confirmed, cancelled)

4. Reviews
Allows users to review properties they‚Äôve stayed in.

Key Fields:

id: Primary identifier

user_id: Foreign key to Users (the reviewer)

property_id: Foreign key to Properties (the reviewed property)

rating: Numeric score (e.g., 1‚Äì5)

comment: Text feedback from the user

5. Payments
Handles transactions for bookings.

Key Fields:

id: Primary identifier

booking_id: Foreign key to Bookings

amount: Total payment amount

payment_date: Date of transaction

payment_status: Status of the payment (e.g., successful, failed)

üîó Entity Relationships
A User can have multiple Properties (if they are a host).

A Property can have many Bookings, but each Booking belongs to one Property.

A Booking is made by one User and for one Property.

A Review is posted by a User for a Property and is typically linked to a past Booking.

A Payment is associated with a single Booking.




üöÄ Feature Breakdown
This project includes essential features that replicate the core functionality of a real-world booking platform like Airbnb. Each feature is designed to enhance user experience and support platform scalability.

1. User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. It supports authentication and role distinction between hosts and guests, forming the foundation for all user-based interactions.

2. Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. This feature ensures that property information is easily accessible and manageable for both hosts and potential guests.

3. Booking System
Facilitates the reservation of properties by guests. It includes features like availability checking, booking creation, and booking history management, ensuring a smooth reservation process.

4. Payment Processing
Handles financial transactions securely when users book properties. It ensures that payments are processed, recorded, and linked to bookings for full traceability.

5. Review System
Allows guests to leave reviews and ratings after their stays. This builds trust in the platform and helps users make informed decisions based on previous guest experiences.

6. API Documentation
All API endpoints are documented using the OpenAPI standard, with support for both REST and GraphQL. This makes it easy for frontend teams or third-party apps to integrate with the backend.

7. Database Optimization
Implements indexing and caching strategies to improve performance and reduce query latency. This is crucial for maintaining scalability and a fast user experience as the system grows.



üîê API Security
Securing the backend API is critical for protecting user data, financial transactions, and ensuring platform integrity. The following security measures are implemented to safeguard the Airbnb Clone application.

1. Authentication
What it is: Verifies user identity using secure mechanisms such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or token-based authentication via Django REST Framework.

Why it matters: Ensures that only verified users can access their accounts and perform actions like bookings or property listings, reducing the risk of impersonation and unauthorized access.

2. Authorization
What it is: Restricts access to specific resources based on user roles and permissions (e.g., only hosts can manage properties, only guests can create bookings).

Why it matters: Prevents users from accessing or modifying data they don‚Äôt own, preserving data integrity and platform trustworthiness.

3. Rate Limiting
What it is: Limits the number of requests a user or IP can make in a given timeframe using tools like Django Ratelimit.

Why it matters: Protects against abuse, brute-force login attempts, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by limiting excessive or malicious requests.

4. Input Validation and Sanitization
What it is: Validates incoming data for correct formats and filters out potentially harmful input (e.g., SQL injections or script tags).

Why it matters: Helps prevent common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), ensuring application stability and safety.

5. HTTPS Enforcement
What it is: Ensures all data transmission between clients and the server is encrypted using SSL/TLS.

Why it matters: Prevents man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and ensures sensitive data like passwords and payment details are transmitted securely.

6. Secure Payment Processing
What it is: Utilizes third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe) that comply with PCI-DSS standards.

Why it matters: Protects financial information during transactions, minimizes liability, and builds user trust in the platform.

These layered security strategies work together to protect the application from unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruptions.




üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline
What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery. It is a set of practices that automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code. CI ensures that new code changes are automatically tested and integrated into the main codebase, while CD automates the deployment of these changes to production or staging environments.

Why It Matters for This Project
Implementing CI/CD ensures:

Faster and safer deployments

Reduced manual errors

Immediate feedback on code quality and functionality

A more efficient and scalable development workflow

This is crucial for the Airbnb Clone project to maintain high-quality standards as features grow and the development team collaborates.

Tools Used
GitHub Actions: Automates tasks such as testing, linting, and deploying code on every push or pull request.

Docker: Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

Docker Compose: Helps run multi-container applications (e.g., Django app, PostgreSQL, Redis) locally and in CI.

Heroku / AWS / Render / DigitalOcean (optional): Can be used as deployment platforms to host the application.
